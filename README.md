# GameFeel

GameFeel is a web-based laboratory designed to explore and analyze the concept of "game feel" in video games. Game feel includes elements such as camera movement, target tracking, screen shake, and recoil that define how a game feels to play. These parameters are often invisible yet crucial to player experience. This project provides an interactive environment to experiment with these parameters and directly observe their effects.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to help players, designers, and developers better understand the mechanics that shape the feel of a game.  
GameFeel serves as a learning and testing tool where users can tweak camera follow speed, delay, or screen shake intensity in real time and see how different settings affect the experience.

## Features

- **Camera Lab:** Experiment with camera follow speed, lag, and easing functions to see how the camera tracks a moving target.
- **Screen Shake:** Simulate screen shake effects used in games and adjust intensity.
- **Compare Mode:** Load two parameter sets side by side to perform A/B testing. Users can load their own settings via URL and compare them with defaults or other custom configurations.
- **URL Sharing:** Share your parameter configuration with a simple URL so that others can load and experience it instantly.

## Target Audience

- **Game Developers:** Quickly test and prototype camera and movement settings.
- **UI/UX Designers:** Evaluate how feedback and smoothing parameters affect player experience.
- **Players:** Understand how different camera or aim settings create unique game feel and experiment with their own preferences.
